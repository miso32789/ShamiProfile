        <h1>Reasons to consider me</h1>
            <p id="reasons">Hello and Welcome to my page. As a new developer you will be able to see the dedication I have set for myself in taking an accelarated course to learn about developing. 24 weeks is not a long time to learn so many new skills but I have done so. With the information and links I provie, you will be able to get a full understanding of my skills and maybe my flaws. I understand that I am still learning but I would like to consider myself moldable. Like a block of clay you will get to mold me into exactly what the role/company needs combined with my other skills I will be sure to have a big impact on the future work as well as become an asset to your company </p>
